# Disease_prediction_web_app
Hello followers! 
Our project name is "Disease prediction using machine learning". It is a web based application where we are providing madical facilities to ensure resources in critical time.
Our facilities are:

1. A system to predict a human being has a disease positive or negative.
2. A quick Ambulance information and its location nearby.
3. A quick Blood Bank location its information nearby.
4. Nearest Pharmacy location and information.
5. Nearest Treatment Centre location and its information.

• In prediction system we have provided only three disease prediction (Diabetes, Heart Disease and Parkinson's Disease) for now.
To predict disease you need a test report containing attribute values related to that particular disease. Those attributes will help to predict the disease.

• In Ambulance section you type a city and we will provide nearest ambulance information with location. 
• And for other facilities we have provided the same things like you provide the city name and we will provide the information with location.

We think that our project will be a great help for not only the critical patients but for the non critical patients also.
